# Welcome!!

My name is Efthymis Michalis. My life flow could be described as a super position space. Inspired by arts and philosophy. Starting abstractly and ending to the core. 

Based on the above paragraph, theres no difference with the projects approach. 

Those projects many times, starts from paper and crafted graphical description with mathematical language. Algorithms comes from the other side as an approaching method. 

My work is to reduce the gap between maths and algorithms. Until this gap is bellow by a suitable threshold.
